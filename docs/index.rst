   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ghcontribs's documentation!
======================================

``ghcontribs`` is a little package to facilitate getting a user's history of
GitHub contributions (pull requests and issues created) for further
analysis. It includes a few simple tools to simplify access to the list of
contributions via the GitHub GraphQL API, and then to write those to JSON
files for later use.

Using this will require creating your own `personal access token
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>`_
for GitHub.
